		<description>Elizabeth the Marathon Girl                                                                                                   Cngratulations on your accomplishments.  I canont wait to hear all about it.  As you know I DNF&#039;ed at IMFL last year.  And like you I am pretty satisfied with what happened.  I still have not decided what IM I want to attempt yet and my blogging has gone by the wayside.  Maybe I need to get a new &quot;notebook&quot; myself.</description>

		<description>Who is Laurence Lee and exactly how long must we wait for some form of cesrune or hefty sanctioning to be imposed upon this cultural traitor? Does anyone honestly think that Mr. Lee is a Muslim? Would anyone be willing to bet that Mr. Lee doesn&#039;t scurry off after work to a nearby pub and lift a pint? A pint that Muslims would just as soon strike from his hand, preferrably using a sword (with hand still firmly attached to the pint in question).Wilders&#039; Dutch opponents call him a &quot;Judas&quot; even as Mr. Lee is greedily counting out his own thirty pieces of Qatari silver. Let us all see if Mr. Lee will take even further inspiration from the example of Judas Iscariot.</description>
